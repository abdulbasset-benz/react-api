🚀 React + Vite – Unsplash API Image Search

A minimal React project using Vite and Tailwind CSS, connected to the Unsplash API to fetch and display images based on user queries.
📸 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

    Connect to a public API (Unsplash)

    Manage state in React

    Lift state between components

    Render dynamic lists

    Use Tailwind CSS (basic setup)

    🧪 The UI is still a work in progress — styling will be improved later. Functionality was the main focus for now.
